# Project Zomboid

Basically hourly backups of my PZ gameplay in case something unfair or glitchy
happens (or my harddrive crashes) and I want to roll back my save to some
previous point.

Also includes a few scripts I use adjacent to my gameplay, like
[timer.mjs](./timer.mjs) for tracking when TV shows come on and
[parse-tmr.mjs](./parse-tmr.mjs) for parsing radio broadcast files and getting a
schedule for when TV shows and radio broadcasts happen and how they affect the
player.
