tis the downside of early access games lol, but modders fix a lot of the QOL
issues

once enabled, click "accept" and then click "join"

name the server what you want IP is 70.93.40.4 Port is 16261 use whatever
username and password you want

click "save"

after that, in the future it's just load the game, click join, click the server,
and then click "join server" and you'll be in-world in a few seconds

let me know when you're trying to join the server, I'll start it up and jump on
as well

we'll be starting at 2AM **in Rosewood** on day one of the infection

you probably want a strength-type build like firefighter or lumberjack being an
axe wielding maniac can be a lifesaver

when you spawn in: always move via crouching (press C), close all the curtains
in the house, grab the food, turn the tv down (if you have a tv) and switch to
the life and living channel. Eat the fresh food, keep the canned food on you.
Look around for bags and other goodies in the house you spawn in.

we should be able to see each other on the map (press M). The plan: we'll make a
run to the fire station to try and get axes and survive on from there
